## **How to Download and Package the Mod**

1. **Download the Mod Files**:
   - On this page, click the green **Code** button near the top-right.
   - In the dropdown menu, click **Download ZIP**. This will download a file called something like `bpl-armory-main.zip`.

2. **Extract the ZIP File**:
   - Locate the downloaded ZIP file (usually in your `Downloads` folder).
   - Right-click the file and select **Extract All...** (on Windows) or use a tool like WinRAR or 7-Zip to extract it.
   - Once extracted, you’ll have a folder named `bpl-armory-main`.

3. **Navigate to the Mod Root**:
   - Open the extracted folder (`bpl-armory-main`).
   - Continue navigating through the folders until you find the mod's root files. The root should look something like this:
     ```
     gui/
     weapons/
     xenopediagraphics/
     ammos.xml
     items.xml
     researches.xml
     weapons.xml
     modinfo.xml
     ```
   - You should **not** see an extra folder at this level. If you still see subfolders like `bpl-armory-main`, keep going deeper.

4. **Create a Proper ZIP Archive**:
   - Once you’re in the folder with the mod’s root files, select **all** the files and folders in that directory (e.g., `gui/`, `weapons/`, `modinfo.xml`, etc.).
   - Right-click the selection and choose **Send to > Compressed (zipped) folder** (on Windows) or use your preferred archiving tool.
   - Name the ZIP archive whatever you like (e.g., `BeepleLabsArmory.zip`), but ensure the archive starts directly with the mod files (not with a folder).

## **How to Install the Mod in Xenonauts**

1. **Find the Xenonauts Installation Folder**:
   - Locate where Xenonauts is installed on your computer. This depends on where you bought the game:
     - **Steam Version**: Go to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Xenonauts\assets\mods`.
     - **GOG or Other Versions**: Look for the `assets/mods` folder inside your Xenonauts installation directory.

2. **Copy the ZIP Archive**:
   - Move the ZIP file you just created (`BeepleLabsArmory.zip`) into the `mods` folder.
   - Your folder structure should look like this:
     ```
     Xenonauts/
       ├── assets/
           ├── mods/
               ├── BeepleLabsArmory.zip
     ```

3. **Enable the Mod**:
   - Launch Xenonauts and go to the **Mod Manager** in the main menu.
   - You should see `Beeple Labs Armory` in the list of available mods. Enable it by selecting it and adjusting its priority if needed.

## **What If Something Goes Wrong?**

1. **The Mod Doesn’t Show Up**:
   - Ensure the ZIP archive is correctly structured and starts with the mod's root files (not an extra parent folder).
   - Make sure the ZIP file is located directly inside the `mods` folder.

2. **The Game Crashes or Doesn’t Work**:
   - Double-check that all mod files are intact and correctly packed into the archive.
   - Ensure you’ve downloaded the latest version of the mod.

3. **Need Help?**:
   - Open an issue here on GitHub (click the **Issues** tab at the top of the page) or reach out to the Xenonauts community for troubleshooting.
